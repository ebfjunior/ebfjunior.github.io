Hey guys!

After a long time away from my blog, I am back, and with full power! 

I know I said in my [last post][retrospectiva-2017] I would be more active here, but I've also told you guys that I started to work at OLX in the beginning of this year. It has been being an incredible journey of changes, challenges and learning, then you can realize how much busy I've been being.

But there is no apologies for being absent, and I intend to become more frequent in my posts from now on. And since I am facing so many changes in this year, why not start to write in a different language also? In this way, I believe I could reach more people, and it's not a bad ideia to brush up my english, right?

But, jumping the crap, let's go to what really matters. Today we will talk a little about *Functional Programming* with Javascript!

<!--more-->

It's truth that Javascript has born with a bunch of functional features, and over the years the language has evolved even more in this way, but there are still so many concepts that most developers don't know, and which could bring a lot of improvements on your code.

## Ok, but what is this functional programming?

Well, if you remember about mathematical functions that you've learnt at school, you are probally one step forward to dive into the functional world. That's because the functional programming treats you program as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

But what does it exactly mean?

For example, do you remember that one of the premises for a mathematical function is that, given a number of known parameters, your function must always calculate the same result? This one (and some others) is also a premise for functional programming, but i will cover that in a near future.

We could define functional programming as the process of writing code in a declarative way, through pure functions, avoiding side effects, mutable data and shared state.

Then lets figure out what some of these concepts mean:

## Pure functions

## Side Effects

## Immutability
